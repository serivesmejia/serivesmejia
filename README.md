# Sebastian Erives - creating computer vision tools at [deltacv](https://deltacv.org)

I started EOCV-Sim, a simple tool for high schoolers competing in the FIRST Tech Challenge to aid with the development of their robotics computer vision algorithms, which has been used by hundreds of teams since its inception.
<br><br>I'm working under <i>deltacv</i> to build a computer vision platform that aims to make prototyping, testing, and deployement faster and easier than ever before.
<br><br>Always eager to learn more and be part of new projects. If you're interested in my skills, find me at serivesmejia@deltacv.org
